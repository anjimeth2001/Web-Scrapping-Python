      "19.6 ➜ Asitha Fernando to Ramesh Mendis, 2 runs Jaffna hold their nerve! What a game, what a finish! Low full-toss, darted on the pads, and all Mendis can do is hack this to deep midwicket. They run back for the second, but the throw is safely into Kusal Mendis's hands. Jaffna win by one run!\n",
      "19.5 ➜ Asitha Fernando to Ramesh Mendis, SIX runs And he's found it! Low full-toss and Ramesh Mendis has absolutely smoked this straight down the ground, through the line and all the way\n",
      "19.4 ➜ Asitha Fernando to Ramesh Mendis, 2 runs Cracking yorker on off, dug out down the ground to long-on. They scramble for a desperate two but the throw misses the stumps\n",
      "19.3 ➜ Asitha Fernando to Ramesh Mendis, FOUR runs Finds the boundary! Full on off, just misses the yorker length. Clears the front leg, frees the arms, high elbow lofted straight drive and there's no chance for long-off\n",
      "19.2 ➜ Asitha Fernando to Ramesh Mendis, no run low full-toss chipped to long-on on the bounce. Mendis turns down the single. Was that the right move? Rathnayake is no tailender\n",
      "19.1 ➜ Asitha Fernando to Rathnayake, 1 run Starts with an excellent yorker, squeezed out to long-on\n",
      "18.6 ➜ Behrendorff to Rathnayake, 1 run Another yorker, low full-toss really, drilled to long-on\n",
      "18.5 ➜ Behrendorff to Rathnayake, 2 runs Good yorker, whipped to deep midwicket. They hustle back for two\n",
      "18.4 ➜ Behrendorff to Rathnayake, SIX runs And it's gone for a maximum! Wow, wow, wow. Misses the yorker and Pavan has just launched this over long-on\n",
      "18.4 ➜ Behrendorff to Ramesh Mendis, (no ball) 1 run Balls gone, the BAT'S gone, and it's caught to boot! This was a high full-toss outside off. Mendis hacks at it, and ends up slicing it to backward point, while his bat went to square leg. They go upstairs to check for a waist high no-ball, and the third umpire says it is. Pretty tight in my opinion, but umpire Ruchira Palliyaguruge was certain\n",
      "18.3 ➜ Behrendorff to Ramesh Mendis, no run full toss outside off, Mendis goes across the wicket and sweeps it, but straight to backward square leg\n",
      "18.2 ➜ Behrendorff to Ramesh Mendis, SIX runs Swivel pulled away over deep midwicket! Skips down the track, it's a back of a length slower ball. His eyes are not really on this, but he goes through the shot and somehow he middles the pants off it\n",
      "18.1 ➜ Behrendorff to Ramesh Mendis, FOUR runs Good start! Back of a length outside, forehand over mid-off, just whacked away\n",
      "17.6 ➜ Allen to Ramesh Mendis, 1 run good length on the stumps, nudged to midwicket for one\n",
      "17.5 ➜ Allen to Ramesh Mendis, FOUR runs Reverse sweep for four! This was chipped to Asitha at short third, who is unsure whether to go for the catch or stay back, in the end he's in no man's land and this spins away from him and races away\n",
      "17.4 ➜ Allen to Rathnayake, 1 run good length outside off, pushed into the covers off the back foot for one\n",
      "17.3 ➜ Allen to Angelo Mathews, OUT Fabian Allen is having the day of all days! This one is fuller, and arrowed in. Mathews looks to heave this onside and misses. On any other day this is a simply a dot ball, but on Fabian Allen Day, it ricochets off the thigh guard and clatters into the stumps\n",
      "17.2 ➜ Allen to Angelo Mathews, 2 runs good length outside off, this time punched into the covers\n",
      "17.1 ➜ Allen to Angelo Mathews, no run good length wide outside off, swing and a miss\n",
      "16.6 ➜ Behrendorff to Chaturanga, OUT Direct hit just when they needed it! Chaturanga backs away and drives this fuller one on darted in straight to extra cover. He wants the single but Mathews correctly turns him back. The throw from Nissanka though is a bullet and Chaturanga is barely in the frame\n",
      "16.5 ➜ Behrendorff to Angelo Mathews, 1 run back of a length on the pads, worked to deep square leg. Just the one\n",
      "16.4 ➜ Behrendorff to Angelo Mathews, FOUR runs Clears short fine! Short again, again gets inside the line but this time is able to get enough on it to clear the man in the circle behind square\n",
      "16.3 ➜ Behrendorff to Angelo Mathews, no run Slower one short of a length, swings and misses. This bounces over leg stump, so no wide given\n",
      "16.2 ➜ Behrendorff to Chaturanga, 1 run short of a length just on off, backs away and chops this to mid-off\n",
      "16.1 ➜ Behrendorff to Angelo Mathews, 1 run Slower one short of a length just outside off, 115kph, controlled pulled to deep square leg\n",
      "15.6 ➜ Allen to Shanaka, OUT Allen you absolute beauty! Good length, pitches on leg, grips and turns to strike the top of off stump. Shanaka, the hero last time out, is gone early here as goes for the big slog across the line and misses completely\n",
      "15.5 ➜ Allen to Shanaka, 2 runs good length on the stumps, makes room and pokes this into the offside\n",
      "15.4 ➜ Allen to Angelo Mathews, 1 run good length on the stumps, worked to long-on off the front foot\n",
      "15.3 ➜ Allen to Angelo Mathews, FOUR runs Edged and four! Pushed through quick wide of off, Mathews has a ungainly swing but gets a thick bottom edge past the keeper\n",
      "15.2 ➜ Allen to Shanaka, 1 run length on off, 92kph, backs away and swats it it square on the off side\n",
      "15.1 ➜ Allen to Angelo Mathews, 1 run darted on the pads, turned to short fine for one\n",
      "14.6 ➜ Viyaskanth to Shanaka, no run Huge appeal for leg before! Not out says the umpire. It's the googly and Shanaka has not read it. He is caught on the crease and it's strikes him just above the knee roll. They opt not to review.\n",
      "14.5 ➜ Viyaskanth to Kamindu Mendis, OUT Huuuuge wicket! Viyaskanth has tossed it up, bravely, but this time it's the googly. Kamindu goes once more for the slog sweep but this time he doesn't get the connection. There's still a lot of work to do though at long-on, but DDS makes good ground and holds on to this under pressure\n",
      "14.4 ➜ Viyaskanth to Kamindu Mendis, SIX runs Here we go! Kamindu breaks the shackles! This was short of length, Kamindu is waiting on one knee and he just wallops it over deep square leg\n",
      "14.3 ➜ Viyaskanth to Angelo Mathews, 1 run low full toss but only a single as Mathews swings it away to deep midwicket\n",
      "14.2 ➜ Viyaskanth to Angelo Mathews, no run wide yorker almost, dug out as point cuts it off\n",
      "14.1 ➜ Viyaskanth to Kamindu Mendis, 1 run good length on the stumps, heaved to wide long-on in the air briefly\n",
      "13.6 ➜ Dhananjaya to Kamindu Mendis, 1 run full on off, driven to long-off\n",
      "13.5 ➜ Dhananjaya to Angelo Mathews, 1 run short of a length on the stumps, clubbed to deep midwicket\n",
      "13.4 ➜ Dhananjaya to Kamindu Mendis, 1 run tossed up on off, looks for the reverse and just about gets some glove on this. Through the keepers legs\n",
      "13.3 ➜ Dhananjaya to Angelo Mathews, 1 run good length on off, dragged to midwicket off the back foot\n",
      "13.2 ➜ Dhananjaya to Angelo Mathews, no run good length and flat outside off, play and a miss with little foot movement\n",
      "13.1 ➜ Dhananjaya to Angelo Mathews, no run darted in quick on off, 93kph, knocked to Dhananjaya's right as he dives and stops it\n",
      "12.6 ➜ Viyaskanth to Angelo Mathews, 1 run full outside off, pushes this to long-off for one\n",
      "12.5 ➜ Viyaskanth to Hasaranga, OUT Viyaskanth has the Kandy skipper! This was tossed up, but it's a good length wide of off. Looks to go against spin and launch it over long-on. Ends up splicing it towards long-off where - who else? - Fabian Allen is lurking to settle under yet another catch\n",
      "12.4 ➜ Viyaskanth to Kamindu Mendis, 1 run short of a length on the stumps, pulled to deep midwicket. Kamindu lets out a groan of frustration\n",
      "12.3 ➜ Viyaskanth to Hasaranga, 1 run goes back and nudges this through midwicket for\n",
      "12.2 ➜ Viyaskanth to Hasaranga, SIX runs Inside out over extra cover! Another one tossed up, Wanindu makes room, leans back and just launches this into his favoured region\n",
      "12.1 ➜ Viyaskanth to Hasaranga, FOUR runs Well placed! Tossed up on leg, Hasaranga clears the front foot and heaves this between the boundary riders at deep midwicket and long-on\n",
      "11.6 ➜ Asitha Fernando to Kamindu Mendis, FOUR runs Edged for four! Back of a length, angled away from off. Kamindu looks to swing this away over mid-on, but gets a very fortunate inside edge that runs away fine\n",
      "11.5 ➜ Asitha Fernando to Hasaranga, 1 run attempted yorker on leg stump, dug out to midwicket for a quick single\n",
      "11.4 ➜ Asitha Fernando to Hasaranga, no run Well directed bouncer! Wanindu clears that front leg as a first motion, but this one is right on him as he sways out of the way\n",
      "11.3 ➜ Asitha Fernando to Kamindu Mendis, 1 run skips down the track and swings it down to deep midwicket\n",
      "11.2 ➜ Asitha Fernando to Hasaranga, 1 run full on middle and leg, Hasaranga stays deep in the crease and looks to work it onside. Ends up getting a leading edge almost, in the air but well short of long-on\n",
      "11.1 ➜ Asitha Fernando to Kamindu Mendis, 1 run full outside off, slapped straight to mid-off. Kamindu missed out on this one\n",
      "10.6 ➜ Viyaskanth to Hasaranga, no run good length just outside off, defensive push to backward point\n",
      "10.5 ➜ Viyaskanth to Mohammad Haris, OUT Haris's wild innings comes to an end! And it's Fabian Allen in the action once again! Haris comes down the track as Viyaskanth holds the length back a touch, looks to hoick it over long on but ends up slicing it high into the Colombo sky. Allen sprints around from long-on and holds on to a very well judged catch\n",
      "10.4 ➜ Viyaskanth to Kamindu Mendis, 1 run darted in on the boots, whipped through square leg\n",
      "10.3 ➜ Viyaskanth to Mohammad Haris, 1 run goes back and works this through midwicket\n",
      "10.2 ➜ Viyaskanth to Kamindu Mendis, 1 run skips down the track and lifts this into the vacant midwicket region\n",
      "10.1 ➜ Viyaskanth to Mohammad Haris, 1 run Another hilarious effort from Haris! Looks to take this from outside off and paddle it over fine, ends up scooping it high over the keeper. Falls wide of short third\n",
      "9.6 ➜ Dhananjaya to Mohammad Haris, 1 run darted in on the pads as Haris looked to make room. Worked to deep backward square leg\n",
      "9.5 ➜ Dhananjaya to Kamindu Mendis, 1 run good length on off, gets forward and nurdles this through midwicket for one\n",
      "9.4 ➜ Dhananjaya to Kamindu Mendis, no run Huge appeal for caught behind as this one slides down leg, Kamindu looks to sweep but doesn't connect. They go upstairs to review, but not sure there was any bat on this. Definitely glances the pad on the way through - likely the sound Mendis heard behind the stumps. Not out.\n",
      "9.3 ➜ Dhananjaya to Mohammad Haris, 1 run fuller on the pads, glanced fine for one\n",
      "9.2 ➜ Dhananjaya to Mohammad Haris, SIX runs Haris goes hard! Too short from DDS, and this is bread and cheese for Haris who just rocks back and monsters this pull over deep square leg\n",
      "9.1 ➜ Dhananjaya to Kamindu Mendis, 1 run back of a length on off, punched to long-on\n",
      "8.6 ➜ Viyaskanth to Mohammad Haris, no run lovely googly, rips back in sharply, and Haris who was caught on the crease does well to get some bat on this. Inside edge into his pads\n",
      "8.5 ➜ Viyaskanth to Mohammad Haris, 2 runs good length on off, again. Reverse sweep, chipped high and just beats the man at short third\n",
      "8.4 ➜ Viyaskanth to Mohammad Haris, no run good length just outside off, 91kph, gives this one a little more air. Misses the cut\n",
      "8.3 ➜ Viyaskanth to Kamindu Mendis, 1 run good length on the stumps, 95kph, swept to deep square leg\n",
      "8.2 ➜ Viyaskanth to Kamindu Mendis, 2 runs short of a length, 99kph, on the stumps, worked to the left of long-on for a couple\n",
      "8.1 ➜ Viyaskanth to Kamindu Mendis, no run good length outside off, 91kph, comes down the track but straight back to the bowler\n",
      "7.6 ➜ Dhananjaya to Kamindu Mendis, 1 run swept behind square now for a single\n",
      "7.5 ➜ Dhananjaya to Kamindu Mendis, FOUR runs Clears the extra cover! Tossed up outside off and Kamindu executes this cover drive to perfection\n",
      "7.4 ➜ Dhananjaya to Mohammad Haris, 1 run short of a length on the stumps, pulled to deep midwicket\n",
      "7.3 ➜ Dhananjaya to Kamindu Mendis, 1 run back of a length, pushed through flatter on off. Pulled to long-on\n",
      "7.2 ➜ Dhananjaya to Kamindu Mendis, no run full and wide, slapped straight to short extra cover\n",
      "7.1 ➜ Dhananjaya to Kamindu Mendis, 2 runs good length outside off from around the wicket, driven into the covers for a couple\n",
      "6.6 ➜ Allen to Mohammad Haris, 2 runs fuller on off, driven wide of long-off for a couple\n",
      "6.5 ➜ Allen to Mohammad Haris, no run short of a length outside off, cut square straight to cover\n",
      "6.4 ➜ Allen to Kamindu Mendis, 1 run tossed up outside off from over the wicket, steps across and works it through midwicket\n",
      "6.3 ➜ Allen to Fletcher, OUT And this time it's right through him! Very similar to the last one but this one is straighter. Fletcher again shapes up to cut but has to adjust late. Doesn't read the arm ball and looks to just block, but he's late on the stroke as this zips through to crash into off stump\n",
      "6.2 ➜ Allen to Fletcher, no run this one is pushed through quicker outside off as Fletcher chops it on to his pads\n",
      "6.1 ➜ Allen to Fletcher, no run grip and turn away from off, as Fletcher makes too much room on the leg side\n",
      "5.6 ➜ Asitha Fernando to Mohammad Haris, no run slower one outside off on a length, cuts and gets an edge but it bounces through to the keeper\n",
      "5.5 ➜ Asitha Fernando to Fletcher, 1 run full on the pads, clipped to deep backward square leg. Fletcher hobbles gingerly to the other side\n",
      "5.4 ➜ Asitha Fernando to Fletcher, no run cracking yorker, squeezed out just about\n",
      "5.3 ➜ Asitha Fernando to Mohammad Haris, 1 run pulled to deep square leg for one\n",
      "5.2 ➜ Asitha Fernando to Mohammad Haris, SIX runs What an unreal shot! How do I even describe it? Reverse swat, off the back of the bat that has just flown fine of short third man all the way for six! Just how, it was a low full-toss as well\n",
      "5.2 ➜ Asitha Fernando to Mohammad Haris, 1 wide looks for another yorker, but slides down leg. Wide given as the bowler thinks there's something on it\n",
      "5.1 ➜ Asitha Fernando to Fletcher, 1 leg bye Lovely yorker, just manages to squeeze this behind square on the leg side for one. Seems to have missed the bat and on to the boot\n",
      "4.6 ➜ Allen to Mohammad Haris, FOUR runs Clubbed down the ground! Tossed up on leg, backs away, leans back and smacks it down the ground. Beats long-off. 50 up for Kandy\n",
      "4.5 ➜ Allen to Mohammad Haris, no run skips down the track and looks to heave this against the spin. Inside edge into the pads\n",
      "4.4 ➜ Allen to Mohammad Haris, no run back of a length just outside off, looks to cut and misses as this turns away from the right hander\n",
      "4.3 ➜ Allen to Mohammad Haris, no run full on the stumps, hacked to mid-on\n",
      "4.2 ➜ Allen to Mohammad Haris, no run Full outside off, squeezed to mid-off\n",
      "4.1 ➜ Allen to Chandimal, OUT Chandimal is gone! Allen is ecstatic! This one drifted in full and deflects straight off Chandimal's boot before careening into middle stump. The Kandy coach has his head in his hands, he knows how important that wicket is\n",
      "3.6 ➜ Azmatullah to Fletcher, no run Searing yorker, and one that Fletcher has done really well to just keep out\n",
      "3.5 ➜ Azmatullah to Fletcher, FOUR runs Lifted over backward point! Back of a length outside off, skips down the track, adjusts to the short length, uses the pace and just lifts it over the infield\n",
      "3.4 ➜ Azmatullah to Fletcher, no run Shuffles down the track again, this time looks to go through the offside, but it's slapped straight to mid-off\n",
      "3.3 ➜ Azmatullah to Fletcher, SIX runs Three in three! Skips down the track, makes this slower length ball into a fuller one and just launches it over cow corner\n",
      "3.2 ➜ Azmatullah to Fletcher, SIX runs Even bigger! Drags the length back but same result. Just a short-arm jab but this sails over deep midwicket!\n",
      "3.1 ➜ Azmatullah to Fletcher, SIX runs Greeted with a six! So, so good from Fletcher. Good length but too straight. He gets inside the line and just flicks it over deep backward square leg\n",
      "2.6 ➜ Behrendorff to Chandimal, FOUR runs And salt in the wounds! Short of a length and this pull has been clattered in front of square\n",
      "2.5 ➜ Behrendorff to Fletcher, 1 run Nearly a run out! Another one pace-off and Fletcher dabs it to backward point. The run is just not on but they take it. All the man has to do is hit the stumps but he misses. Chandimal would have been out my metres\n",
      "2.4 ➜ Behrendorff to Fletcher, no run Swing and a miss! Back of length on the stumps. Looks to pull this but is early on the stroker\n",
      "2.3 ➜ Behrendorff to Fletcher, FOUR runs Muscled away! Good length just outside, Fletcher just hacks across the line and beats the diving midwicket. Not much timing but a lot of power\n",
      "2.2 ➜ Behrendorff to Fletcher, no run Good length, pace-off, wicket to wicket. Appeal for leg before and given! Insta-review from Fletcher! And the replays vindicate him, clear inside edge on this. It might have been pitching just outside leg as well\n",
      "2.1 ➜ Behrendorff to Chandimal, 1 run back of a length on off, push and run towards cover\n",
      "1.6 ➜ Asitha Fernando to Fletcher, FOUR runs Just about clears short fine leg! Back of a length but on leg, gets inside the line and whips it fine. Behrendorff has height on his side, but even he can't leap and grab this one\n",
      "1.5 ➜ Asitha Fernando to Fletcher, no run back of a length, and hurries him this time. Looks to cut but this is too close to him, inside edge into the pads\n",
      "1.4 ➜ Asitha Fernando to Fletcher, SIX runs Glorious! Good length on off, but this drive from Fletcher is oustanding. Sumptuous check-drive straight into the sightscreen, quality stuff\n",
      "1.3 ➜ Asitha Fernando to Fletcher, no run full on the pads, whipped straight to midwicket\n",
      "1.2 ➜ Asitha Fernando to Chandimal, 1 run Whipped away, but somehow the man at deep backward square saves the boundary! Back of a length on middle and Chandimal picks it up, it races to the boundary rider but he does well to just get his body behind it\n",
      "1.1 ➜ Asitha Fernando to Chandimal, no run back of a length on off, defended into the turf off the back foot\n",
      "0.6 ➜ Behrendorff to Fletcher, no run back of a length outside off, dabbed straight to backward point\n",
      "0.5 ➜ Behrendorff to Chandimal, 1 run back of a length on off, runs this down behind point for one\n",
      "0.4 ➜ Behrendorff to Chandimal, no run back of a length, nips in and cramps Chandimal for room\n",
      "0.3 ➜ Behrendorff to Chandimal, FOUR runs Chipped through midwicket! This was fuller and shaping in a touch on middle and leg, but Chandimal does well to get that front foot out of the way and flicks it away\n",
      "0.2 ➜ Behrendorff to Chandimal, no run Good carry! Back of a length, pitches on middle and leg and goes across the right hander. Beats him well\n",
      "0.1 ➜ Behrendorff to Chandimal, no run back of a length on off, defended off the back foot\n",
